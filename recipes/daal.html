  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    In Hindi, ‘dal’ or ‘dahl’ is the generic term for lentils as well as the recipes made from lentils. Dal or lentils are a
    staple in Indian cuisine and make for an excellent plant-based source of protein.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dal Fry is a dish that is made in various ways in many Indian homes with tur dal or pigeon pea lentils.
    If you are new to Indian cuisine, you may think that ‘dal fry’ indicates that some ingredient is being fried or the
    lentils are fried. Let me assure you that we don’t fry anything in a dal fry.

      <h4>Pressure cook the dals</h4>
      <p>
        Dal Recipe is a blend of delicious dal and spices. Here's how you can make it at home. Take a pressure cooker and fill it
        with 4 cups of water. Now, add toor dal, chana dal and masoor dal in water. Add salt in the cooker, close the lid and
        cook it on a medium flame for 5 whistles and then turn off the flame. Keep the cooker aside.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Saute the vegetables</h4>
      <p>
        Now take a non-stick pan and heat 4 tsp. ghee on a medium flame. Then add 1 tbsp chopped garlic and ginger. When garlic
        becomes light brown, add sliced onions. Add chopped green chilli.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Add spices & cook until the vegetables until tender</h4>
      <p>
        Saute until onions are translucent. Add chopped tomatoes and season it with turmeric and red chilli powder. Cook until
        tomatoes become tender.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Add cooked dal, water & let it simmer</h4>
      <p>
        Now open the lid of the cooker and add cooked dal in the pan. Also, add 2 cups of water and stir to mix well. Sprinkle
        salt and cook on a medium flame for 5 minutes. Let it cook and thicken.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Prepare the tempering</h4>
      <p>
        Stir occasionally to check the consistency of dal, then remove from flame and carefully transfer it to a large bowl and
        keep it aside. Meanwhile, take a small pan, heat the remaining ghee on medium flame and add cumin seeds and crush two
        dry red chillies. Then add asafoetida and heat it for a few seconds.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Pour the tempering over cooked dal & garnish before serving</h4>
      <p>
        Now pour the prepared tempering over cooked dal in the bowl. Garnish dal with chopped coriander leaves and remaining
        garlic. Serve while it’s hot.
