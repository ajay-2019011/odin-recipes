  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    One of my favorite things to order at Indian restaurants is paneer. It is a fresh cheese (i.e., not aged like parmesan)
    that is common within Indian and Southeast Asian cuisines. Paneer has a chewy texture and generally doesnâ€™t have much
    flavor on its own. To add flavor to the paneer, you can dice the paneer into cubes and add it to flavorful sauces or you
    can pan fry them.

    If there is one thing that all vegetarians love to have, it's Paneer or Cottage Cheese. So, we thought of bringing you
    the recipe for the most popular cottage cheese that can be found in every restaurant - Shahi Paneer.

  <h2>Steps</h2>

      <h4>Chop all the veggies and make almond-cashew paste</h4>
      <p>
        To prepare this creamy shahi paneer recipe, chop the onion, green chillies, tomatoes along with ginger and coriander
        leaves separately. Now in a bowl, add the curd and whisk it well. If you are in a hurry, you can also use tomato puree
        instead of chopped tomatoes. To make this recipe more delicious, you can dry roast the spices separately and then add
        them to the gravy. This will make your recipe more aromatic. Now, grind cashews and almonds separately using a little
        water and make cashew and almond paste. Keep them aside until required.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Prepare onion-tomato gravy using curd</h4>
      <p>
        Next, put a pan on medium flame and heat 3 tbsps of ghee in it. Add the chopped onions, ginger, green chillies along with
        green cardamoms for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomato puree and cover the pan with a lid. Cook for about 8 to 10 minutes.
        Then, add the beaten curd, cook for another 5 minutes and pour a cup of water into the pan. Cook for another 2 minutes.
        When the gravy is cooked, let it cool down at room temperature. When it's cool enough, add it to a mixer jar and blend
        till smooth and keep aside.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Add paneer cubes in the gravy and cook for 3-5 minutes</h4>
      <p>
        Now, heat the remaining ghee in another pan and add the ground gravy in it along with red chilli powder, garam masala
        powder, cashew and almond paste along with salt. Bring it to a boil or till the gravy thickens. Then add the paneer
        cubes and milk. Cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. While the gravy is being cooked, cut the paneer into cubes and keep it
        aside till required. Take two cubes and grate them for garnishing.

      <h4>Garnish and serve</h4>
      <p>
        Garnish this delicious North Indian paneer recipe with chopped coriander leaves and grated paneer. If you like it
        creamier, you can add some fresh cream. This will not only make your dish look appetising but at the same time, it will
        add to the taste. Serve hot with roomali roti or naan and enjoy!
